            <h2>Full-Stack software developer</h2>
            <p>I love to create things that work and can be used efficiently. That is why I started looking towards
                software development in the first place. My goal is to create software that helps the work/life of
                people by making processes more efficient.</p>

            <h2>Instructions set</h2>
            <p>All computers run using very low-level command which do some ver ybasic functions, such as reading data,
                writing data, jumping to addresses, and calculating basic arithmetic. (The complete list of commands
                that can be run by a CPU is known as that</p>
            <h2>Transistor / Switch</h2>
            <p>It is an idealized or physical device implementing a Boolean function; that is, it performs a logical
                operation on one or more binary inputs and produces a single binary output.</p>
            <h2>ASCII</h2>
            <p>It stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange. Computers can only understand numbers,
                so it is the numerical representation of a character such as 'a' or '@' or an action of some sort.</p>
            <h2>RAM</h2>
            <p>It is a form of computer data storage which stores frequently used program instructions to increase the
                general speed of a system. It can be randomly accessed. Data items to be read or written in almost the
                same amount of time irrespective of the physical location of data inside the memory.</p>
            <h2>Programming Language</h2>
            <p>A formal language that specifies a set of instructions that can be used to produce various kinds of
                output. They generally consist of instructions for a computer and can be used to create programs that
                implement specific algorithms.</p>
            <h2>Domain Name System / DNS</h2>
            <p>A hierarchical decentralized naming system for computers, services, or other resources connected to the
                Internet or a private network. It associates various information with domain names assigned to each of
                the participating entities.</p>
            <h2>HTTP / Hypertext Transfer Protocol</h2>
            <p>An application protocol for distributed, collaborative, and hypermedia information systems. It is the
                foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web. It is the standard protocol to exchange or
                transfer hypertext.</p>
